# OpgnGL-exp

Getting back on track with OpenGL two years after I first learnt it on [Christian Jacquemin's course](https://perso.limsi.fr/jacquemi/OGL/index.html) at Paris-Sud University.

One of my motivations is to get more used to OpenGL, have some snippets laying around in a repo and eventually start a side project like an OpenGL accelerated editor, computer generated art or a simple game.

# Requirements

- GLM
- GLFW
- GLEW
- CMake
- Ninja build system
- C++17 compliant compiler (`g++ 8.2.1` being used for this project's development)

Each preferably to the latest version as this project is developped on Arch.

# Build & run

Simply run these :

- Build : `./build`
- Run : `./bin/Release/prog`
