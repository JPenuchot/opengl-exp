# OpgnGL-exp

Getting back on track with OpenGL two years after I first learnt it on [Christian Jacquemin's course](https://perso.limsi.fr/jacquemi/OGL/index.html) at Paris-Sud University.

One of my motivations is to get more used to OpenGL, have some snippets laying around in a repo and eventually start a side project like an OpenGL accelerated editor, computer generated art or a simple game.
